## Motivation
I think compound interest is very powerful and some people fail to see the magic of compound interest. I wanted to build a quick application to help people visually see how quickly money can grow when reinvested and allowing adequate time for it to grow. As well as showing people how quickly debt can grow when not taken care of responsibly. While building this I learned all about state and props. Passing props, passing functions, updating state, and more. I found a very nice charting library, [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/), that I leveraged to build the responsive charts after building the dataset with the user given parameters.
